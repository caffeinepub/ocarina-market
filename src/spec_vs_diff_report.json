  "summary": "Implementation partially addresses category-based pricing requirements. REQ-1 and REQ-2 are implemented through both a migration script and a backend method that updates prices to $9 for 3D printed items and $19 for ceramic items. REQ-3 is only partially implemented: a frontend UI (CategoryPriceEditor) exists but only applies hardcoded prices, not dynamic category selection and price specification as required.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-3",
      "requirement": "Admin interface that allows bulk price updates by category with category selection and custom price specification",
      "reason": "The CategoryPriceEditor component only applies hardcoded prices ($9 for 3D printed, $19 for ceramic) via a single button. It does not allow admins to select a category from a dropdown and specify a custom price as required by the acceptance criteria.",
